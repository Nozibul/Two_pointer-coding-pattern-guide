## Overview

Master the Two Pointer Pattern with this comprehensive PDF guide! Learn to identify the right problems in seconds and streamline your coding solutions. Enhance your algorithmic thinking today.
The Two Pointer technique is a fundamental algorithmic pattern used to solve array and string problems efficiently. Instead of using nested loops (O(n¬≤)), this technique reduces time complexity to O(n) by using two pointers that traverse the data structure strategically.

## Key Concepts

### When to Use Two Pointers:
- **Array/String manipulation** problems
- **Searching pairs** with specific conditions
- **Palindrome** checking
- **Sliding window** problems
- **Merge operations** on sorted arrays

### Types of Two Pointer Approaches:
1. **Opposite Direction** - Start from both ends, move towards center
2. **Same Direction** - Both pointers start from same position
3. **Fast & Slow** - Different speeds for cycle detection

## Implementation Examples

### Pattern 1: Opposite Direction Pointers
```python
def two_sum_sorted(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = arr[left] + arr[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return [-1, -1]
```

### Pattern 2: Same Direction Pointers  
```python
def remove_duplicates(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    write_index = 1
    
    for read_index in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[read_index] != arr[read_index - 1]:
            arr[write_index] = arr[read_index]
            write_index += 1
    
    return write_index
```

### Pattern 3: Fast & Slow Pointers
```python
def has_cycle(head):
    if not head:
        return False
    
    slow = fast = head
    
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    return False
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------|
| Brute Force | O(n¬≤) | O(1) | Simple nested loops |
| Two Pointers | O(n) | O(1) | Optimized linear scan |
| Hash Map | O(n) | O(n) | When two pointers not applicable |

## Common Patterns

### üéØ Pattern Recognition Guide

**Use Two Pointers When:**
- Array/string is **sorted** or can be sorted
- Looking for **pairs/triplets** with specific sum
- Need to **reverse** or **palindrome** check
- **Sliding window** maximum/minimum problems
- **Merge** two sorted sequences

**Avoid Two Pointers When:**
- Need to track **multiple elements** simultaneously  
- **Random access** patterns required
- **Complex state** management needed
